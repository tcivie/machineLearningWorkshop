# Machine Learning Workshop Project
## Introduction
Welcome to my Machine Learning Workshop Project! This ongoing project kicks off with a deep dive into feature
extraction, the crucial first step in preparing our data for more complex machine learning tasks.
As the project evolves, I will be exploring additional aspects of AI and machine learning, 
adapting and expanding our objectives and methodologies.

### Current Stage: Feature Extraction
#### Overview
Feature extraction lays the groundwork for any machine learning project by transforming raw data into a more manageable,
informative set of features that effectively represent the underlying problem to our algorithms.

#### Data Source
I'm utilizing the rich datasets provided by [MindBigData](https://mindbigdata.com/opendb/index.html),
which offer a diverse range of data points perfect for our initial and future experiments.

#### Techniques Employed
* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
* **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**
* **Autoencoders**

I'm implementing these techniques to reduce dimensionality, visualize high-dimensional data, and learn efficient data
representations.
